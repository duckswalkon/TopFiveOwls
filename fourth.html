            <p>Not only the most widely found species of owl but also one of the most widely distributed bird species in the entire world, the barn owl takes the cake in the rankings due to its sheer number found both in the wild and near residential areas. As the name implies, the barn owl prefers to make its nest around agricultural grazing areas. Despite its snowy, tan feathers beaming the pallid moonlight the barn owl makes for a vicious predator, doing its part in the ecosystem by hunting pest animals that would otherwise plague crops.</p>
